# createlistofprimes

## Summary

`createlistofprimes` is a command-line program written in C that generates a
list of prime numbers up to a given limit and saves the result to a file in a
structured directory.

The program is designed to be used as a standalone utility and as a supporting
tool for larger projects.

---

## Description

This program calculates all prime numbers up to a user-defined numeric limit and
stores them in a text file inside a dedicated directory.

The upper limit must be greater than zero and smaller than the maximum value
supported by the `Number` type, defined in `commonfunctions.h`.

In addition to generating prime lists, the program records relevant execution
data in log files, allowing other applications to reuse the generated
information.

The project is currently complete and stable.

---

## Directory Structure

Before execution, the following directories must exist in the program's root
directory:

createlistofprimes/
├── lists/
└── logs/

- `lists/`  
  Stores the generated lists of prime numbers.

- `logs/`  
  Stores log files related to program execution.

The program must be executed from the directory where these folders are located.

## Example Files

The `lists/examples/` and `logs/examples/` directories contain sample output
files generated by the program. These files are provided as references to
illustrate the expected format and structure of prime lists and log files.

All other files generated during regular execution are intentionally excluded
from version control.

---

## Usage

### Basic Syntax

createlistofprimes <limit> [--file-name]

### Parameters

- `<limit>`  
  Positive integer that defines the upper bound for prime number generation.  
  Must be greater than 0 and smaller than the maximum value of `Number`.

- `--file-name` (optional)  
  If provided, the output file name will include the numeric limit.

---

### Examples

Generate primes up to 500 using the default file name:

createlistofprimes 500

Generate primes up to 500 using a custom file name:

createlistofprimes 500 --file-name

---

## Output

### Prime List File

The generated file is saved inside the `lists/` directory.

#### Default Name

lists/list_of_primes.txt

#### With `--file-name` Option

lists/list_of_primes_up_to_<limit>.txt

Example:

lists/list_of_primes_up_to_500.txt

---

### File Format

Each output file follows this structure:

- Line 1:  
  Contains the total number of primes and the largest prime found, using the
  format:

quantity=<count>,last=<largest_prime>

- Line 2 onward:  
One prime number per line.

Example:

quantity=95,last=499
2
3
5
7
11
...

---

### Log File

The largest prime number found during execution is stored in:

logs/primelog

This file can be used by other applications to access the latest computed
result.

---

## Error Handling

- All runtime errors are reported to the user via messages.
- When an error occurs, the program terminates immediately.
- A non-zero exit code is returned to indicate failure.

---

## Dependencies

### Standard Libraries

This project mainly uses standard C libraries.

### Platform-Specific Library

- `direct.h`  
  Used for directory handling on Windows systems.

### Project Headers

- `commonfunctions.h`  
  Provides the definition of the `Number` type used for numeric limits.

---

## Build

This project can be compiled using standard C compilers on Windows.

Example (GCC / MinGW):

gcc -o createlistofprimes src/main.c src/*.c

Adjust paths as needed depending on your project structure.
